                <p>
                    I was born in a country in Central Asia that was a part of the USSR and then lived in a few towns in
                    Russia before moving to Australia.
                    My birth town is literally in the middle of a desert. After moving to Russia I went to college and
                    studied railway automation.
                    I continued my education and graduated from a university as an engineer with major in IT in railway
                    industry.

                    After graduation I worked in Support and QA roles for 3 years.
                    The company I worked for specialized in automation of business processes and enterprise software.
                    We were building task and inventory management system for field technicians.
                    I was responsible for quality and releasing of location tracking component.
                    Once upon a time, being a responsible QA engineer I walked several kilometers around the office to
                    measure tracking accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After being a release engineer for nearly a year I joined a logistics company thinking about my future
                    career.
                    This was when my husband was relocated to Australia, so we moved together. I spent a year working on my
                    English and some more time improving my soft skills and extending my technical skills.
                    I went through a bunch of tech MOOCs and got into coding, so I joined Coder Academy to structure my
                    knowledge, fill in the gaps and to fight the fear of looking stupid.
