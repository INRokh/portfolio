            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in a country in Central Asia that was a part of the USSR and then lived in a few towns in
                Russia before moving to Australia.
                My birth town is literally in the middle of a desert. After moving to Russia I went to college and
                studied railway automation.
                I continued my education and graduated from a university as an engineer with major in IT in railway
                industry.

                <div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-secondary text-center text-white rounded">
                    <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
                    <p>I've been studying trains for nearly 10 years!</p>
                </div>
            </aside>
            <p>
                After graduation I worked in Support and QA roles for 3 years.
                The company I worked for specialized in automation of business processes and enterprise software.
                We were building task and inventory management system for field technicians.
                I was responsible for quality and releasing of location tracking component.
                Once upon a time, being a responsible QA engineer I walked several kilometers around the office to
                measure tracking accuracy.

            </aside>
            <p>
                After being a release engineer for nearly a year I joined a logistics company thinking about my future
                career. Then we moved to Australia.
                I completed a bunch of tech MOOCs and got into coding, so I joined Coder Academy to structure my
                knowledge, fill in the gaps and to fight the fear of looking stupid.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I like watching the TV and I'm proud of it! By TV I mean watching good shows and movies on Netflix or
                Stan.
                When I run out of good content I have to go outside. I grew up living by the mountains and I always like
                hiking.
